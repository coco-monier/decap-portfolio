    url: ""
    desc: No words are spoken, but there’s a conversation happening — one that’s
      been unfolding for centuries, passed from hand to hand, breath to breath.
      It’s in the taste of something old and sacred, something that holds space
      for more than just sweetness. It’s the alchemy of it all, the quiet magic
      that turns the ordinary into something else, something more. You can feel
      it, the way it wraps itself around you. Not a weight, but a presence, like
      love that doesn’t need to speak to be understood. It moves with the grace
      of a story half-remembered, a memory that lingers at the edge of your
      mind, just out of reach. You don’t chase it. You let it come to you, like
      the tide, like the light that filters through the trees just before dusk.

  - title: All that remains
    url: ""
    desc: A hand reaches out, barely brushing against the petals of a flower too
      wild to be named. The air hums with a kind of knowing, not loud, but
      present, steady like the heartbeat of the earth. You don’t notice when the
      shift happens, when the familiar melts away into something softer,
      something richer, something that feels like it’s always been here,
      waiting. Time bends, stretches, holds you in place. You can’t rush through
      this, not here.

    desc: illumination and diffusion. Sunlight pouring through a shōji screen in a
      tea house. Something to be felt, not spoken of. Architecture and the play
      of light. A captivating presence and a sense of stillness.

    desc: This is where love lives. Not the kind written in books or whispered in
      the dark, but the kind that breathes, untamed and uncontainable. It dances
      on the edges of what you think you know, inviting you to step a little
      closer, to lean in just enough to catch its rhythm.
  - image: /static/img/selfpub_brandmark.jpg
    desc: Symbols, always symbols, passed back and forth, gathering dust and meaning
      as they travel. They aren’t here to decorate — they’re here to nudge, to
      remind you that the rulebook was never yours to follow. A glance down at
      the bracelet as you laugh at the wrong moment, as you cry in a meeting
      because it all matters too much or not at all. The pieces move with you,
      breathe with you. You’re not a statue, your life isn’t a gallery, and the
      story isn’t finished.

    desc: There’s a ring on your finger, but it isn’t just metal. It holds the
      weight of a hundred stories whispered into the night. Not finished, not
      polished — just like you, still writing, still collecting. It moves with
      you, catching light like a secret you haven’t told anyone yet. The kind of
      secret that feels too wild to tame, too true to share, but here it is,
      worn on your skin, wrapped around your pulse.

    desc: Wake up to your destiny in all its beauty and ugliness. In whatever form
      momentum means for you. Wake up to the movement that emancipates your from
      these endless bardo boredom cycles of life that we all know too well.

    desc: This space—between you and the world—is where the future grows, quietly
      and without fanfare, rooted in choices made with intention, with care. You
      may not see it all, but you feel it in the weight of the fabric, in the
      way it rests against your skin, in the way it asks you to consider the
      hands that made it, the earth that birthed it. Nothing here is taken
      lightly, and yet, there’s a softness to it all, a quiet invitation to move
      more gently through the world, to tread lightly, knowing that each step
      leaves a trace.

    desc: There is a pulse deep within the earth, steady and sure, mirroring the
      quiet hum that moves through you, unnoticed but always present. You are
      not separate from this pulse. It moves in you as it moves in the roots
      that stretch through soil, in the leaves that catch the wind

    desc: The vines, weathered and wise, grow with a patience born from the dance
      between sun and soil, a slow exchange of elements that cannot be hurried.
      Each root reaches deeper, not for more, but for what has always been
      there, waiting just below the surface. Each root reaches deeper, not for
      more, but for what has always been there, waiting just below the surface.

      back into commercial design. It’s our dream to build dexterous brands that
      pair esoteric poetry with a modern tongue for conscious, inpsired,
      relevant market expression. Our nose leads us to like-minds who share a
      sparkle in the eye. We find their hands filled with a labour of love. By
      learning the ways of their craft and how their dreams touch ground with
      reality, we find the contours that define it’s outer shape, and we journey
      deep to the particles of it’s creation. The diversity of this handy work
      has no limit. We are the ghost in the machine.
