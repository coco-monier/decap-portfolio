    desc: Shed the anxiety. Live in your heart. Feel, feel, feel. Feel the comfort
      of self acceptance, scrap that, of self LOVE, wrapped around you. Feel it
      like the sun on your skin, the sand in your toes, the warmth of a summer
      evening on your sun kissed skin. Its a giddy feeling of de-ja-vu joy, but
      is it a de-ja-vu feedback loop of that feeling of being totally present.
      Nature will always bring you here. The calm knowing. She loves you. Love
      her back.

    desc: Myths are at once familiar and unknowable. Humans by nature are
      mythologically inclined. Despite our increasingly logical society, we
      retain a perpetual desire for the mystery, the magic and the unexplainable
      in life. We play with the idea of a golden age. But instead of glorifying
      the past and condemning the present and future, we twist this myth into a
      more optimistic vision.

    desc: "We need all types of beauty. Here is the beautiful messy alchemy of
      existence. Here is where we get out of our heads, our hearts, ourselves.
      We live for one another, whether we realise it or not. We exist in
      continuum, ever flux affecting each other in hidden movements. Our silent
      glances echoing over our faces. "

    desc: The depth of the simple act of tea is subtle and needs to be felt to be
      understood. All we stand for and aim to give is contained within our
      simple and humble forms. There’s a rustic simplicity and quiet contained
      in natural texture. A sensation to be felt. A calling to pause and seek
      the silence within.

    desc: We believe a visual vocabulary can work as a family, but the subtleties
      lay in how we subvert the monotonous zietgiests of identity and bring art
      back into commercial design. It’s our dream to build dexterous brands that
      pair esoteric poetry with a modern tongue for conscious, inpsired,
      relevant market expression. Our nose leads us to like-minds who share a
      sparkle in the eye. We find their hands filled with a labour of love. By
      learning the ways of their craft and how their dreams touch ground with
      reality, we find the contours that define it’s outer shape, and we journey
      deep to the particles of it’s creation. The diversity of this handy work
      has no limit. We are the ghost in the machine.

    desc: Visualising illumination and diffusion. The ambiance of sunlight pouring
      through a shōji screen in a tea room. Something to be felt, not spoken of.
      Architecture and the play of light combine to create a captivating
      presence that embodies stillness. Diffusion — the movement of particles to
      achieve balance.

      liberation in expressing our truth and connecting with others that
      encourage and uplift us. We are honest about what we want and what feels
      good. We are not bound by conventions. We believe in universal love — the
      love between a circle of friends, queer love, love unbounded, euphoric
      love. We know no shame for indulgence of the highest kind. We do what
      feels good and we feel good about doing it. "

    desc: A guide, a mirror, a vessel for transformation. An unearthing rather than
      a becoming. Through the release of restriction, we return to the raw and
      intuitive — a subtle rebellion against self-imposed limits, and an embrace
      of freedom as a state of being.

    desc: "A sensation of balance can go beyond expected symmetry. The zen and wabi-
      sabi mind is sensitively  attuned to deeper experiences of balance: like
      the balance between a large shape that is light-coloured (signifying
      sparseness) and a small dark shape (signifying density). It is not about
      the minds interpretation. It requires a feeling to be read and
      understood."

    desc: Certain places carry a resonance, or an energy. As with any metaphysical
      experiences, they can be difficult or near impossible to convey —
      especially through words. When trying to authentically express the
      inexpressable we will come across as half-baked or lost in our subjective
      bubble of belief. If we are too playful we risk undermining the
      authenticity of the experience.

    desc: Hold that spirit, that tiny crazy diamond. It will light the way. Keep it
      as your anchor, your mainstay. It will see you through. Through to a you
      that is self-knowing, inner-facing and not outer-listening. Live for what
      moves you. Don’t rush it. These are precious and fragile as snowflakes.
      Trust yourself. Stay put in your bathysphere as long as you need. Here is
      the place where everything is permitted, nothing forbidden. The safety of
      this palace is unfathomable, omnipotent but hyper-local. It exists in the
      eye of the needle, in the central seat of the soul. Extend it out slightly
      and you find yourself. The you that’s grounded here on this particular
      patch of earth with all its dirty history.

      between sun and soil, a slow exchange of elements that cannot be hurried.
      Each root reaches deeper, not for more, but for what has always been
      there, waiting just below the surface.

    desc: Work hard and hardly work. Take time and waste it too. Constantly quest to
      listen more. Never support war zone diamonds. Only laugh at funny jokes.
      Resist Captivity. Shun the tyranny of expectations. Cry at work..just
      once. Never give up (Except if we're really really tired). Be kind, swipe
      off, check the stars. Be still, look up, thank the moon. Stay weird.
      Hustle like a MF.

      for you. Wake up to the movement that emancipates your from these endless
      bardo boredom cycles of life that we all know too well. We are a voice
      whose only hope is to strike a sound of discord in the hum of society. The
      hum of refrigerators and supercomputers and the endless burning of money

      norms, physical boundaries, or personal inhibitions.
