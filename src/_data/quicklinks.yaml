    desc: We believe a visual vocabulary can work as a family, but the subtleties
      lay in how we subvert the monotonous zietgiests of identity and bring art
      back into commercial design. It’s our dream to build dexterous brands that
      pair esoteric poetry with a modern tongue for conscious, inpsired,
      relevant market expression. Our nose leads us to like-minds who share a
      sparkle in the eye. We find their hands filled with a labour of love. By
      learning the ways of their craft and how their dreams touch ground with
      reality, we find the contours that define it’s outer shape, and we journey
      deep to the particles of it’s creation. The diversity of this handy work
      has no limit. We are the ghost in the machine.
