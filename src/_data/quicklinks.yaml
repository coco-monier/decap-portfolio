    desc: Shed the anxiety. Live in your heart. Feel, feel, feel. Feel the comfort
      of self acceptance, scrap that, of self LOVE, wrapped around you. Feel it
      like the sun on your skin, the sand in your toes, the warmth of a summer
      evening on your sun kissed skin. Its a giddy feeling of de-ja-vu joy, but
      is it a de-ja-vu feedback loop of that feeling of being totally present.
      Nature will always bring you here. The calm knowing. She loves you. Love
      her back.

    desc: The depth of the simple act of tea is subtle and needs to be felt to be
      understood. All we stand for and aim to give is contained within our
      simple and humble forms. There’s a rustic simplicity and quiet contained
      in natural texture. A sensation to be felt. A calling to pause and seek
      the silence within.

    desc: We believe a visual vocabulary can work as a family, but the subtleties
      lay in how we subvert the monotonous zietgiests of identity and bring art
      back into commercial design. It’s our dream to build dexterous brands that
      pair esoteric poetry with a modern tongue for conscious, inpsired,
      relevant market expression. Our nose leads us to like-minds who share a
      sparkle in the eye. We find their hands filled with a labour of love. By
      learning the ways of their craft and how their dreams touch ground with
      reality, we find the contours that define it’s outer shape, and we journey
      deep to the particles of it’s creation. The diversity of this handy work
      has no limit. We are the ghost in the machine.

    desc: Myths are at once familiar and unknowable. Humans by nature are
      mythologically inclined. Despite our increasingly logical society, we
      retain a perpetual desire for the mystery, the magic and the unexplainable
      in life. We play with the idea of a golden age. But instead of glorifying
      the past and condemning the present and future, we twist this myth into a
      more optimistic vision.

    desc: Work hard and hardly work. Take time and waste it too. Constantly quest to
      listen more. Never support war zone diamonds. Only laugh at funny jokes.
      Resist Captivity. Shun the tyranny of expectations. Cry at work..just
      once. Never give up (Except if we're really really tired). Be kind, swipe
      off, check the stars. Be still, look up, thank the moon. Stay weird.
      Hustle like a MF.

    desc: Make the same mistake as many times as we bloody well like. Use words like
      "bloody". Fix the broken stuff. Face the unfixable. Pass the power on.
      Make something, anything. Occasionally follow the rules. Take deep
      breaths. Call our parents, and if we can't, call someone else's. Keep
      secrets (or at least whisper them . Learn how to bake bread (or at least
      banana bread).

    desc: A state of boundless possibility, where limitations are absent and the
      entire world, or even the universe, is open for exploration and
      experience. It takes the mindset of ‘wide open road’ and poses a deeper
      sense of existential freedom—where one is not constrained by societal
      norms, physical boundaries, or personal inhibitions.

    desc: Hold that spirit, that tiny crazy diamond. It will light the way. Keep it
      as your anchor, your mainstay. It will see you through. Through to a you
      that is self-knowing, inner-facing and not outer-listening. Live for what
      moves you. Don’t rush it. These are precious and fragile as snowflakes.
      Trust yourself. Stay put in your bathysphere as long as you need. Here is
      the place where everything is permitted, nothing forbidden. The safety of
      this palace is unfathomable, omnipotent but hyper-local. It exists in the
      eye of the needle, in the central seat of the soul. Extend it out slightly
      and you find yourself. The you that’s grounded here on this particular
      patch of earth with all its dirty history.

    desc: This space—between you and the world—is where the future grows, quietly
      and without fanfare, rooted in choices made with intention, with care. You
      may not see it all, but you feel it in the weight of the fabric, in the
      way it rests against your skin, in the way it asks you to consider the
      hands that made it, the earth that birthed it. Nothing here is taken
      lightly, and yet, there’s a softness to it all, a quiet invitation to move
      more gently through the world, to tread lightly, knowing that each step
      leaves a trace.

    desc: There is a pulse deep within the earth, steady and sure, mirroring the
      quiet hum that moves through you, unnoticed but always present. You are
      not separate from this pulse. It moves in you as it moves in the roots
      that stretch through soil, in the leaves that catch the wind. There’s a
      subtle connection, a rhythm shared between your breath and the breath of
      the world, always in sync, though often forgotten.

    desc: The vines, weathered and wise, grow with a patience born from the dance
      between sun and soil, a slow exchange of elements that cannot be hurried.
      Each root reaches deeper, not for more, but for what has always been
      there, waiting just below the surface.

    desc: We only live forever. Nothing comes from nothing, nothing returns to
      nothing. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be changed
      from one form to another. Einstein said that. Anyway, everything is
      something. Joy is always there, from before and till forever. So is love.
      Life will never pass into nothingness. And so, what shall we do with
      eternity? Take care. Take care of each other. Take care of the earth. Be
      held by her and her heavenly bounty. And give back to her, far more than
      we take.

    desc: Instead of a mono-brand, we needed to create a world filled with mountains
      and valleys, harmonies and tensions. A world that embodies both ancient
      craftsmanship and a vibrant, modern hotel experience. Anything short of a
      transcultural and temporal synthesis was going to fail to feel true to
      what is happening here at Jacumba.

      await those who dare venture into its ethereal embrace. Shifted
      perspectives challenge the notion of what is visible and dives into the
      realm of what is felt....the unseen—for it's here we discover the hidden
      treasures of life and unlock new dimensions of experience.

      of life no longer at your door. It’s positive, free and joyful and despite
      at first glance appearing to lean into the vintage, has simplified
      expressions that actually create a very modern, ownable brand that has a
      rich and unique voice in the landscape.
